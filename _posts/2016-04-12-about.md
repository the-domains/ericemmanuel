Hey, hi, welcome to my neighborhood.

So what brings you here?

Me? Sweet!

Who am I?

Well,

My name is Eric Emmanuel Kayanan but to those who know me, E.

I'm currently a visual creative attempting to expand perception through the art of storytelling.

I revel in learning new things. To change and to grow are of upmost importance. Self mastery is the continuous goal, and the ongoing journey, is how I define life. 

Initially the intent behind this was to pressure myself into creating more. The site was to act as a tool to hold myself accountable. Ultimately the purpose is to make who I am as creative accessible to future clients. To share my perspective and demonstrate my aesthetic.

Thanks for visiting & enjoy. 

I offer my services as a creative via [DFFRNTWRLD(r)][0].  Hop on over and book an appointment.
