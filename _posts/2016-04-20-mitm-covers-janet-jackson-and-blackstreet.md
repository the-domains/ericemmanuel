Overthinking. Risking it all?

So often we skip out on doing what we love due to rationalizing it with the time & energy needed to put into it, versus the financial return. 

Cliche right? Do it for the love and the money will come.

As I'm watching a young local band debut some new material to a crowd of 40 or so, I'm reminded that **_no great art is birthed out of financial necessity. _**

Maybe that could have been the case after a certain level of success had been reached, but certainly no at first.

These young musicians undoubtably have other ways to financially support them and probably devout a majority of their free time to their craft. **It's evident by the quality of their sound. **

Giving thanks are in order for the experience and the reminder that devotion to your craft and/or love,against all else, is truly living. 

Give Thanks.
